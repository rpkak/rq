# Supervisor

## Putting RQ under supervisor

[Supervisor](http://supervisord.org/) is a popular tool for managing
long-running processes in production environments. It can automatically
restart any crashed processes, and you gain a single dashboard for all
of the running processes that make up your product.

RQ can be used in combination with supervisor easily. Youâ€™d typically
want to use the following supervisor settings:

```ini
[program:myworker]
; Point the command to the specific rq command you want to run.
; If you use virtualenv, be sure to point it to
; /path/to/virtualenv/bin/rq
; Also, you probably want to include a settings module to configure this
; worker.  For more info on that, see http://python-rq.org/docs/workers/
command=/path/to/rq worker -c mysettings high default low
; process_num is required if you specify >1 numprocs
process_name=%(program_name)s-%(process_num)s

; If you want to run more than one worker instance, increase this
numprocs=1

; This is the directory from which RQ is ran. Be sure to point this to the
; directory where your source code is importable from
directory=/path/to

; RQ requires the TERM signal to perform a warm shutdown. If RQ does not die
; within 10 seconds, supervisor will forcefully kill it
stopsignal=TERM

; These are up to you
autostart=true
autorestart=true
```

### Conda environments

[Conda](https://conda.io/docs/) virtualenvs can be used for RQ jobs
which require non-Python dependencies. You can use a similar approach as
with regular virtualenvs.

```ini
[program:myworker]
; Point the command to the specific rq command you want to run.
; For conda virtual environments, install RQ into your env.
; Also, you probably want to include a settings module to configure this
; worker.  For more info on that, see http://python-rq.org/docs/workers/
environment=PATH='/opt/conda/envs/myenv/bin'
command=/opt/conda/envs/myenv/bin/rq worker -c mysettings high default low
; process_num is required if you specify >1 numprocs
process_name=%(program_name)s-%(process_num)s

; If you want to run more than one worker instance, increase this
numprocs=1

; This is the directory from which RQ is ran. Be sure to point this to the
; directory where your source code is importable from
directory=/path/to

; RQ requires the TERM signal to perform a warm shutdown. If RQ does not die
; within 10 seconds, supervisor will forcefully kill it
stopsignal=TERM

; These are up to you
autostart=true
autorestart=true
```
